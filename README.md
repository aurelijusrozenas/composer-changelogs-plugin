Composer Changelogs Plugin
==========================

This plugin allows easier access to package changelogs, when you want to check what's actually been changed, before
doing `composer update` in your project.

**At the moment this is only a quick spike, without any tests, regard for safety, or whatever. DO NOT use it in
production.**
